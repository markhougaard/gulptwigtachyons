This repo is basically just a ripped version of the same concept.

# What's happening?

Twig takes care of the templates, CSS is knocked out of the park with Tachyons, and there's a tiny Express server with LiveReload so it just updates without you having to hit refresh all the time. That's the stuff.

## What do I need to make it work?

- [Node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/)

If you didn't already run into it, you'll figure out soon enough that Gulp needs to be installed globally. No, I don't know why either, but here's how:

```
npm install -g gulp
```

## Now, how do I make it work?

Clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/marksdk/gulptwigtachyons.git
```

Install the dependencies:

```
cd gulptwigtachyons
npm install
```

Run the default Gulp command:

```
gulp
```

Now open your browser of choice at `http://localhost:3000` and marvel at the wonder that is something that actually works on your computer.

## Now what?

Make sure you edit the .twig files in `/src`, not the .html files in `/web`. If you do that, it will treat you well, and as long as you have Gulp running, all of your changes in the Twig templates will automatically be compiled to HTML. ðŸŽ© Magic âœ¨

Place reusable elements in the `_partials` folder, and include them in the other Twig templates. (See the `<nav>` element in `_layout.twig` for an example).
